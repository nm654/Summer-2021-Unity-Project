Sphere Commentary

Moved 8/3/2021
Rather than waste time on twitter in despair (Taking L's everyday), I should clean up my code so it's actually readable in case things go wrong
I still need to work on the document clean up.
I'll do that once I can get an actually working code for everything.
    //Sphere moves faster and jumps higher (Speed Mode)
    //Cube moves slower but can double jump? (What will the benefit of Cube be?) (Ah! How about having 2 hits instead of... 
    //no. I don't want a checkpoint.)

The minute I get off class and office hours the ADHD kicks in and I end up getting like, 1 thing done.
I wish I could find things that weren't video tutorials...

pdfdrive is right there
7/28/2021: Searching PDF drive for books!

//7/29/2021 Update: I am removing the Jump and It's now a Time Attack?!
// Sure, go with that.
// How do I make it interesting then? If there's no jump?
//Obstacle course with IDK, walls?


    // Update is called once per frame
    
//Hey didn't you have older files? Yeah but 3D... still should work, right? 
//Wait, there's 2D ufo... and that other one... You did this like... last year... check the scripts and files...
//It's been a year! Give me a break! It's like I'm a newbie all over again! (Also I never did 2D, just 3D Stuff...)
// Why did I pick 2D again? (To challenge myself?)

//7/28/2021: Why don't you break down what you need to do?
// Change sprites to be more colored/ Less MS Paint Crude
// Add Jump
// Change Sprite to reflect movement
// Add Music
// Change Goalposts
//Add Blinking
//Player Sprite is fine... It's the goal and platform that need the most work
// Gonna see if I can fix the sprite stuff and then set up the goal's win position. later!



//In Class Update 7/28/2021: Stopped Floor Clipping and also helped movement


  

        


//change velocity for the jump with gravity
//check for jumping when they're touching the ground
//if double jump, add a jump counter 
// if ground is true or jump counter greater than 0, reduce counter by 1 when touching ground and reset 
// Goal Post Works, Jump Does not
//How much would it take for me to make this into some bizarro shmup Like Game
//Make the Goal Post Bigger

//I am Not Implementing the JUMP.
// That'll just be if I have time to do so Later
// What the heck is the Hitbox?!
// Alright Now the Goal Post Works...
//So How do I implement Other levels?
// Uh. Hmmmm.... Level Select? Load Screen? IDK...

//The 7/30 Update: I am in Danger!
//How Do I implement a Pause Screen though lol and A Level Select too?!
// Bruh I don't even have a jump how am I gonna make different levels
// LOWER THE SCOPE?!
// Okay So I can't turn or change my gravity either lol
// You need the Jump then?!
// Okay, So there will be a pause button to go to the title or quit the game somehow....
// Do I need a goal counter to make it so when I fufill it all I get to the win screen?
//You know what. I think I'll just not do that.
// The Scope VS My Actual Ability is non existent. I'm not even sure if I can implement Cube...
// You can! You just can't implement a character select// You'd have to uh. Make A whole set of different levels for cube only? Replace cube with sphere?

// To Do: Implement Character Selection
// Implement Jump and Gravity (NECESSARY)
// Implement Win Screen (If Possible)
// How Do I select Levels? Wait what about a level select where you can just pick and then the quit shows up?
// Oh, so like without a win screen entirely. Guess I'll scrap that.
// A (Level Select Button?)
