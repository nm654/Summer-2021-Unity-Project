Level Ideas

3 Steps is getting Used as Level 6


Wait I've got one. How about a jump tower?
Another one.

Three Steps seems like a valid level to use as well.

Harder Stairway?

I got one? How about Vertical pillars?

So... like the squares but with a different hitbox?

I guess?

Rotating platforms

Platforms Moving Up and Down

Or the Endless Runner Idea...

Could always I dunno, Add to the basics side...
