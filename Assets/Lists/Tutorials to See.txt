Read Unity Tutorial Books to see if there's anything that can be inspired.

Rather than give myself a hard time, shouldn't I start with reading the shortest book to see how much I can get done with it?
No health boxes or enemies, recall?

How about... Pushing blocks?
Hey, not bad! (I have a double jump though...) (It needs to be simple. No puzzles?)


Look Up Endless Runner tutorial
Look Up Shmup Tutorial

Start to Finish Book
Brick Breaker
Brick Dodging Game 

Mastering 2D Development
An RPG?
I think I'd make only like, one map with 4 levels and it'd be like... paper mario with Shapes.

Unity By Example 
Has an Endless Runner Tutorial

The 2D Arcade game is a further version of the brick breaker...

Okay, so I'll do it like this.

Sphere specific Games will be Brick Breaker
Cube will be Brick Dodging
Sphere will be the Shmup
Cube will be the Endless Runner
Sphere and Cube will both be in the RPG (Somehow.)

You may just want to make something along the lines of A Minigames Section at this rate...
Shapes Collection?
