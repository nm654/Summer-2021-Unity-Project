New To Do List (8/4/2021)
You sent in the SEEALSO before checking out the Canvas Requirements. (There's still time to add more?)
Hand in Aesthetic after class (Done)
Color BG Changes
Goal Post Fixes (Cube Edition) (Semi Done)
Scene Management (Level Select (Yeah), Game Plays (Yeah), Quit Games)
Music and Sounds (gamesounds.xyz or something)
Pause and Quit Prompt on All Levels (Working on it)

So, Sphere Exclusive Build...
Why is it full screen and how do I fix the resolution?
You forgot to add a sphere to one of them
Goal Post Works and Kicks you fast
I should add a Quit Button Somewhere in case someone doesn't want to do the full level?
Everything works for the most part aside from the Janky Full Screen...

I'll make more levels. That was embarassingly short.
So I can up it to about 5, maybe add moving platforms or something?
Need a more substantial experience for my work.

Before you Cube Build, did you recall to uh. Fix the goal posts?
Probably not. I'll come up with something.

That SHMUP idea's looking pretty spicy Right now..
Endless Maybe?
Okay so Endless SHMUP maybe, cube gets three shots and sphere gets two shots to make up for the fact cube is SLOW
Hrrgh... I miss thunderforce... 
I'm not making a thunderforce styled shmup, I don't even know how to compose music for it...

Check out Books for it

I think you should just do an endless floater of sorts...
Uhhh. Sure.
WATCH THE VIDEO.
Mmmm.... Ehhhh?

It's either A SHMUP, Endless Runner, or Combo. Uh. When you don't even have 5 levels...
Technically Move and Jump are levels right. (Get out of there with that, those are glorified tutorials!)

So then you'd need a quit prompt button.
Q for Quit, R for Reset, P for Pause...
